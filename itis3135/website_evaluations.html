        <p>Evaluations</p>
        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.nike.com/">Nike.com</Nike></a></h3>
            <p>The offical Nike website for all things Nike news and shopping</p>
            <ul>
                <li>C - Clear and legible font. Simple and effective contrast</li>
                <li>R - Most pages are uniform with large windows/ buttons and banners</li>
                <li>A - Conents of page are alligned with grid (mostly centered banners and icons)</li>
                <li>P - Closely related information is phsycially close</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The website follows good CRAP principles and provides an easy-to-use interface that any potential customer could use for the first time and enjoy. Text is legible, information is display consistently and navigation is seemless.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://bigbearevents.com/">bigbearevents.com</a></h3>
            <p>The website for the Big Bear Lake Oktoberfest event</p>
            <ul>
                <li>C - Harsh contrast from background image but otherwise legible content. Jarring sidebar</li>
                <li>R - Pages follow same margins and general "scaffolding" setup but content is speratic</li>
                <li>A - Generally follows grid, but sidebar is a little jarring</li>
                <li>P - Closely related information is generally phsycially close</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The website follows some bad CRAP principles. The background images of the body and side-navigation-bar are a little jarring and information is not displayed consistently. Videos and images are placed speratically.</p>
