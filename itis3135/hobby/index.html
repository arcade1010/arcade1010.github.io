                    I play caually with my friends and people who also play at belk gym. I call it a hobby because I'm not on any organized team and like to practice
                    in my free time.

            <p>I play casually, usually at Belk gym or Urec and sometimes outside. 
                I play whenever I have free time and energy, and play with whoever

            <h2>History and Progression</h2>
            <p>My mom signed me up for recreational basketball leagues when I was around 10 years old.
                I played on rec teams for a couple years, winning a rec championship and
                havent played oraganized ball since. During gym class throughout middle school and highschool
                I knew some fundamentals but got circles ran around me by most other kids. 
                Near the end of highschool and throughout my year in community college,
                I practiced almost everyday at an outside court by my old middle school. I became
                more consistent in my shooting, handles, driving, post-game and defending. My friends
                would occansionally go play full court 5v5s an the outside courts by my old high school.
                I'm no where near collegiate or professional level, but I can certainly hold my own
                in a recreational game or 1v1/2v2/3v3/4v4.

            <h2>Watch NBA</h2>
            <p>I began watching the NBA in 2020 covid. I don't have a favorite team,
                as I perfer to follow individual players. My favorite player to watch 
                is Kyrie Irving. I like his style of play so much that I was convinced
                to get his brand of shoe both times I needed new basketball shoes. I watch
                NBA games almost every night while I'm doing homework, or bored and want simple
                enterntainment. When I'm really bored I watch certain clips and players closely and on repeat,
                in an attempt to study and immitate their game. My favorite player of all time (the goat)
                is Lebron James, as he entered the league the year I was born and is still 
                performing at an all-star level.
