                        and I'm a junior at UNC Charlotte studying Computer Science. 
                        Throughout this website I'll get the chance to share bits of 
                        myself and my coding journey with you. My Education history, 
                        my coding Projects, more information about me, an overview 
                        of my home PC that I assembled upgraded, and contact information 
                        can be found in the different sections. The navigation bar at the 
                        top will jump you to whichever section you'd like. -Evan

                <p> I began studying here at University
                    of North Carolina at Charlotte in Fall 2022. I'm currently a junior
                    and pursuing a Bachelors degree in Computer Science with a concentration 
                    in Software Engineering. Throughout my academic career I've studied and learnt
                    Java, JavaScript, html and CSS. I've studied data structures, algorithms, and logic
                    theory throughout several courses. I've had the great opportunity
                    to practice and workshop my communication skills in my many public speaking and 
                    ethics related courses.

                <p>I graduated from HHS in May 2021 and attended Wake Tech Community

                    in High School and learned visual basic. I began studying and learning 
                    Java when I went to Wake Tech.
