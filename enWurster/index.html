                <p> I began studying here at University
                    of North Carolina at Charlotte in Fall 2022. I'm currently a junior
                    and pursuing a Bachelors degree in Computer Science with a concentration 
                    in Software Engineering. Throughout my academic career I've studied and learnt
                    Java, JavaScript, html and CSS. I've studied data structures, algorithms, and logic
                    theory throughout several courses. I've had the great opportunity
                    to practice and workshop my communication skills in my many public speaking and 
                    ethics related courses.

                <p>I graduated from HHS in May 2021 and attended Wake Tech Community
                    College for 2 semesters. I took my first beginner programming course 
                    in High School and learned visual basic. I began studying and learning 
                    Java when I went to Wake Tech.

                <p>I developed a comprehensive weather application using Java, integrating a user-friendly interface with JavaFX.
                     The app provides real-time weather updates by leveraging the OpenWeatherMap API, while also utilizing the Geocoding
                     API to convert city names into precise coordinates. To streamline the development process, I employed Maven for build
                      automation and used the Jackson library for efficient JSON parsing. The application features dynamic user input functionality, 
                      allowing users to easily access global weather data, all presented within a clean and intuitive interface.</p>

                <p>As part of a collaborative team of five, I contributed to the development of a comprehensive plan for a campus wellness app. 
                    This project encompassed detailed strategies for both backend and frontend development, effective stakeholder coordination, 
                    and a robust marketing strategy. Key elements included risk management, budget oversight, and quality assurance, all designed 
                    to preemptively address potential challenges and ensure high-quality outcomes. This initiative aimed to enhance campus well-being 
                    through an all-ecnompassing wellness app.

                <p>In my Human Centered Interactions/Design course, I collaborated with a team of three to create the user interface for Music Meet,
                     an app designed to connect musicians seeking to collaborate. Using Figma, we embraced a minimalist and intuitive design approach, 
                     focusing on simplicity and ease of use. The interface features a clean 'Deciding' page for effortless browsing of musician profiles, 
                     an instant messaging system for straightforward communication, and an event creation page for seamless organization of music sessions.
                     We leveraged several design and interaction principles, including progressive disclosure, affordance, visual hierarchy, and consistency 
                     to ensure an intuitive and minimalist user experience.This project underscored the importance of user-centered design, as we aimed to 
                     create a user-friendly experience that aligns with the needs of musicians while maintaining a sleek and efficient interface.
