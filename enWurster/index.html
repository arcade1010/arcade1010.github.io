                        and I'm a junior at UNC Charlotte studying Computer Science. 
                        Throughout this website I'll get the chance to share bits of 
                        myself and my coding journey with you. My Education history,

                <p> I began studying here at University
                    of North Carolina at Charlotte in Fall 2022. I'm currently a junior
                    and pursuing a Bachelors degree in Computer Science with a concentration 
                    in Software Engineering. Throughout my academic career I've studied and learnt
                    Java, JavaScript, html and CSS. I've studied data structures, algorithms, and logic
                    theory throughout several courses. I've had the great opportunity
                    to practice and workshop my communication skills in my many public speaking and 
                    ethics related courses.

                <p>I graduated from HHS in May 2021 and attended Wake Tech Community

                    in High School and learned visual basic. I began studying and learning 
                    Java when I went to Wake Tech.

                <p>In this project, I developed a Java-based Bookstore POS system to streamline customer transactions and inventory
                    management. Doing so required implementing features for adding, updating, and deleting products and membershps in the inventory
                    database, ensuring accurate stock levels and membership lists</p>

                <p>In this project, I designed and built a web-based calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide basic
                    arithmetic operations. I implemented the core functionality of the calculator in JavaScript, allowing users to perform
                    addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</p>
