                    <p class="content1">This is a llama, but my name is Evan Wurster
                        and I'm a junior at UNC Charlotte studying Computer Science. 
                        Throughout this website I'll get the chance to share bits of 
                        myself and my coding journey with you. My Education history, 
                        my coding Projects, more information about me, an overview 
                        of my home PC that I assembled upgraded, and contact information 
                        can be found in the different sections. The navigation bar at the 
                        top will jump you to whichever section you'd like. -Evan

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I graduated from HHS in May 2021 and attended Wake Tech Community
                College for 2 semesters. I began studying here at University
                of North Carolina at Charlotte in Fall 2022. I'm currently a junior
                and pursuing a Bachelors degree in Computer Science with a concentration 
                in Software Engineering. Throughout my academic career I've studied and learnt
                Java, JavaScript, html and CSS. I've studied data structures, algorithms, and logic
                theory throughout several courses. I've had the great opportunity
                to practice and workshop my communication skills in my many public speaking and 
                ethics related courses.
